# Resume File Instructions

## How to Add Your Resume

1. **Place your resume PDF file in this `public` folder**
2. **Rename it to:** `resume.pdf`
3. The resume will be automatically available for download via the "RESUME" button in the navbar

## Current Setup

- The navbar has a "RESUME" button that links to `/resume.pdf`
- When clicked, it will download as `Ajay_Palvai_Resume.pdf`
- Make sure your resume file is named exactly: `resume.pdf`

## File Location

```
d:\sentient-portfolio (1)\public\resume.pdf
```

## Note

Until you add your actual resume PDF file, the download button will show an error when clicked. Simply replace this instruction file with your actual `resume.pdf` file.
